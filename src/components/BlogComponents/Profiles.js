      <h2>Role of personal profiles in supporting your LinkedIn strategy</h2>
      <p>
        We have talked about LinkedIn Company Pages in detail. How about your
        personal profile, though? It turns out that there is a huge potential in
        combining the efforts of a Company Page and personal profiles in
        LinkedIn marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        LinkedIn personal profiles are the best place to showcase your skills
        and expertise. They can also be used to connect with potential customers
        and partners, and they are an integral part of every LinkedIn strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are just three examples of how you can combine your LinkedIn
        profile with your company channels:
      </p>
      <h3>Employee advocacy</h3>
      <p>
        Employee advocacy is a great way to increase brand awareness and connect
        with new audiences. If you have employees who are active on LinkedIn,
        ask them to share your company content with their networks. This will
        help you reach more people, and it also helps to build trust and
        credibility for your brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way, your employees can act as advocates for your company – they
        can promote your products and services, as well as answer questions from
        potential customers using their personal LinkedIn accounts. Taking this
        approach can help your business gain more exposure on LinkedIn and
        create buzz about your offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few different ways you can go about setting up an employee
        advocacy program. You can either give employees guidelines to follow or
        free reign to post whatever they want so long as it’s related to the
        company somehow. You can also provide incentives for employees who
        participate, like giving them extra social media points that they can
        redeem for prizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whichever route you decide to take, employee advocacy can be a great way
        for you to run your LinkedIn strategy. It is a very natural way to
        connect with new audiences and also helps to build trust and credibility
        for your brand via your employees.
      </p>
      <h3>Brand ambassadorship</h3>
      <p>
        Whichever route you decide to take, employee advocacy can be a great way
        for you to run your LinkedIn strategy. It is a very natural way to
        connect with new audiences and also helps to build trust and credibility
        for your brand via your employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have clients who are passionate about your brand, ask them to
        become brand ambassadors. Using their own social media channels, they
        can vouch for your company via posts, messages, comments, or any other
        form of acclamation. This happens in a natural, meaningful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can help you to build trust with potential customers. When people see
        that other people have recommended your product or service, they’ll be
        more eager to try it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, brand ambassadors can help you to reach a larger audience
        on LinkedIn. Their connections and followers can see your content,
        engage with it, and consider doing business with you. Brand ambassadors
        can also help to create social proof for your company.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that potential customers will be more likely to believe that
        you’re a credible source of information and products because other
        people have spoken for you. And since recommendations are the new black
        for business, you should be sure to make the most of them on LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <h3>Social Selling</h3>
      <p>
        Social selling is the process of using social media to promote,
        advertise, and sell your products and services via valuable pieces of
        content that are not always salesy. LinkedIn is the perfect platform for
        social selling because it allows you to connect with potential customers
        in a very personal way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to social selling is to build relationships with potential
        customers before you try to sell them anything. And while Company Page
        content may be too invasive for those who don’t know you yet, your
        network or potential audience on your personal profile may react
        differently to these touchpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can, for example, share your Company Page content on your own
        profile with your own expert comment. Or you can write a long post about
        your industry and trend, but somehow connect it to what you’re
        professionally into by linking to a source in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social selling isn’t only limited to LinkedIn, though! You need to
        choose the right social media platform for your business and target
        groups. While LinkedIn comes as a natural choice for many, it can turn
        out that also Facebook or even TikTok work in your case.
      </p>
      <h2>Benefits of running a successful Linkedin strategy</h2>
      <p>
        For those of you who need yet more reasons to test out LinkedIn strategy
        in your organization, here are a few:
      </p>
      <h3>More professional performance</h3>
      <p>
        A professional presence can give your company an appearance to match
        from the perspective of your existing and potential customers. LinkedIn
        is a good place to post updates about your company, new products or
        services, and blog articles. You can also share photos and videos of
        your team in action, or announce new launches and plans. Now that some
        use LinkedIn as a business card, you don’t want to miss out on that
        either.
      </p>
      <h3>Reach target groups of people</h3>
      <p>
        LinkedIn offers a variety of features that allow you to target specific
        groups of people. You can use LinkedIn Ads to target customers on social
        media based on their job title, company size, or other factors. You can
        also use LinkedIn Groups to connect with potential customers who might
        be interested in what you have to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even just with organic reach on a Company Page, you can access a
        large number of people including those who didn’t already know your
        company existed. LinkedIn has over 770 million users (as of March 2022
        https://about.linkedin.com), so there are lots of potential customers to
        reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2025, LinkedIn is expected to reach one billion users according to
        Statista
        https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1147197/linkedin-users-in-the-world.

      </div>
      <h3>Better employer branding</h3>
      <p>
        Many businesses see the benefits of using LinkedIn for employer branding
        as it can help them attract the best talent. You can post job openings
        on your Company Page and reach a large number of potential candidates
        that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use LinkedIn to connect with potential employees and get to
        know them before you offer them a job. Many headhunters begin their
        candidate screening process on LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <p>
        LinkedIn is also a popular destination for employees on the lookout for
        new jobs, and they may also check out your company. Having a strong
        employer brand will make it easier for you to attract and recruit the
        right people to your team.
      </p>
      <h3>Build thought leadership</h3>
      <p>
        LinkedIn can also be used to build thought leadership. You can share
        blog articles, white papers, and other types of content on LinkedIn.
        This will help you to establish yourself as an expert in your field,
        both as yourself and your brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you share valuable content on LinkedIn, people will start to see
        you as a thought leader in your industry. If you plan quality content on
        social media profiles (including LinkedIn), you can easily attract more
        customers and grow your business.
      </p>
      <h3>Generate leads, extra traffic, and sales</h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          Speaking of growing your business, LinkedIn can be a huge help with
          that.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        When your brand has a strong presence on LinkedIn, you will see an
        increase in leads, website traffic, and sales. If you post engaging and
        interactive content, you are more likely to be discovered by people who
        are searching for what you offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a solid profile and great content, your target market will be more
        likely to visit your website or contact you for business opportunities.
